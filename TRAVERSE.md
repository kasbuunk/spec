# Traverse

How manifestation proceeds.

A traverse instance configures how an interpreter executes [manifest](MANIFEST.md)(specification, constraints) → representation. It governs the journey, not the destination.

**Interpreter-agnostic**: Human, agent, hybrid, swarm, or organization.

## Principles

### 1. Step Size

How much work before reassessment. Granularity calibrates to uncertainty.

### 2. Direction Assessment

How to determine if progress moves toward the goal. Cost of assessment should be proportionate to cost of misdirection.

### 3. Course Correction

How to respond when assessment reveals drift. Options include: adjust, backtrack, abandon, or surface for decision.

### 4. Uncertainty Tolerance

How much ambiguity the interpreter absorbs before surfacing. High tolerance enables autonomy; low tolerance ensures alignment.

### 5. Verification Depth

How rigorously to confirm correctness. Depth reflects cost of undetected error.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Uniform rigor**: Applying equal verification to unequal risk
- **Assessment without method**: Checkpoints that don't specify how to evaluate
- **Implicit autonomy**: Unstated expectations on when to proceed vs. consult
- **Verification theater**: Process that appears rigorous but doesn't catch misdirection
