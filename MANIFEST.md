Specification → representation. Inverse of [DISTILL](DISTILL.md).

**Input**: A specification satisfying [SPECIFICATION.md](SPECIFICATION.md); optional implementation guidance.

**Output**: An artifact satisfying the specification.

**Correctness**: Compliance is determined by the specification's verifiability criteria.

**Freedom**: Any aspect unconstrained by specification or guidance is interpreter's choice. Guidance restricts but never contradicts specification.
